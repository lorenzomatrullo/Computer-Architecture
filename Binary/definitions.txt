1) What is a Binary number?
Binary: 0 1
Two digits to represent  quantitive value

2) Rules for Counting:
*Increase right most column by 1
When you run out of digits:
*Reset column that ran out to 0
*Increase next column by 1


1 byte = 8 bits (each bit is a digit)
1 byte has 256 different configurations which means it can store 256 different numbers.
MINIMUM VALUE = 0
MAXIMUM VALUE = 255
OVERFLOW = a catching situation when we go beyond the MAXIMUM VALUE.
CARDINALITY = size of the array (array base * array bits = MAXIMUM COMBINATIONS)


Each bit till the 8th gets doubled
