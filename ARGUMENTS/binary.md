### **What is a Binary number?**
Represent a quantitive value between <span style = "color:red">0</span> and <span style = "color:red">1</span>
<br>
<br>

### **How to count in Binary?**

&emsp; 1) increase right most column by 1
<br>
&emsp; 2) when you run out of digits -> reset column that ran out to 0
<br>
&emsp; 3) increase next column by 1
<br></br>

### **How is a Binary Number made?**

**1 byte** -> *8 bits* <font size = "1">*(each bit is a digit)*</font>
<br>
**Minimum Value** -> 0
<br>
**Maximum Value** -> 255
<br>
**Overflow** -> *a catching situation when we go beyond the Maxmum Value*
<br>
**Cardinality** = *size of the array (base^bits = Maximum Combinations)*
<br>
<font size = "1">*1 byte has 256 different configurations which means it can store up to 256 different numbers.*</font>
<br>
<font size = "1">*Each bit till the 8th gets doubled.*</font>
