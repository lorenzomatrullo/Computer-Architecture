# Logic Gates

**0** -> OFF -> False -> 0 Volts<br>
**1** -> ON -> True -> 5 volts (something over than 0)

**NPN** : *Negative-Positive-Negative*<br>
**PNP**: *Positive-Negative-Positive*

**Transistor**: *device that is used to control or regulate the flow of electronic signals.*<br>

<font size = "1">Parts of the transistor:<br>
&emsp;&emsp; - **Emitter**: *the transistor's negative lead.*<br>
&emsp;&emsp; - **Base**: the terminal that activates the transistor.<br>
&emsp;&emsp; - **Collector**: *the transistor's positive lead.*</font>


### **Buffer Gates**:

*Strengthens a signal without changing its logic value.<br> 
<font size = "1">(E.G. if it receives a logic 1, it outputs a logic 1, and if receives a logic 0, it outputs a logic 0)*</font>

### **Not Gates**:

**Ä€** = *Complementary of A*

*Not gate is also called a negator, because it "negates" the input.<br>
